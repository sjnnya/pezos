     * The sum (in mutez) of non-staked tokens that currently count as delegated to the baker, excluding those owned by the baker iself. Does not take limits such as overstaking or overdelegation into account. This includes the spendable balances and frozen bonds of all the baker's external delegators. It also includes unstake requests of contracts other than the baker, on the condition that the contract was delegating to the baker at the time of the unstake operation. So this includes most but not all unstake requests from current delegators, and might include some unstake requests from old delegators. Limits such as overstaking and overdelegation have not been applied yet.
